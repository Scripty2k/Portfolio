I used to preach about how amazing it is to grow up. at 10 years old, I already knew what I wanted to be. But when I am growing older, day by day, I slowly lose my imagination of the world. Boredom slowly haunting me more and more. When I was 6, I wanted to be 10. When I was 10, I wanted to be 16. 

Now around this age, I regret sticking my head up in the future instead of the present. I just wish I could stick around my childhood a little longer. I would do anything to relive the worriless state of time. Time goes by quick when you're having the time of your life.

Time goes faster than you think. Use it wisely.
