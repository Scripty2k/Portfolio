You can't force someone to love you. I spent so much time fighting for one sided effections. Trying to be prove my love to people who clearly didn't see the proof of worth I was giving them. I always thought that if I was caring enough, that they would've end up caring for me too. But you can't beg for love. You can't force love. It is all natural work. 

I've not yet to love myself. Even though I need to. I want to. Without having to love myself, I can't share that love to anyone else. Because love doesn't exist if you don't love yourself
