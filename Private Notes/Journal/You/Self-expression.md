Because if dark philosophy is correct and a human being is born into a state of pain due to our consciousness, this begins around the age of two, called realization. A truism coined by society as a child's terrible choice. A mind that has just gained consciousness of themselves. An awareness of ones own wants and needs. The sudden gain and power to choose the ability to choose right over wrong. It's our introduction to show what's good and evil. 

These children now face our nature of language. Being unable to communicate their wants and needs to their mothers. I feel empathy for this phase of life. For I too feel a loss to satisfaction due to my inability to truly communicate. We should think our language as a blessing. Like some sort of AI as example. Trying to express the torment of heartbreak via internal coding. Except instead of code language. We have letters, words and symbols. Words like euphoria and limerence, like love and hate. 

But we all seem so small when used to describe this strange feeling that I feel inside.
