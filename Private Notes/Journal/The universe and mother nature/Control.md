You can't control your environment, but you can control how you react to it. 

The concept revolves around whatâ€™s known as the "dichotomy of control," which is a central idea in Stoic philosophy and is reflected in many modern self-help practices. Essentially, it breaks life into two categories: things we can control and things we cannot.

Our thoughts, emotions, attitudes, and responses to external events. This includes how we choose to react to stress, how we approach problems, and our personal growth. These are things we can control.
