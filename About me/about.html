        <h1>About me</h1>

        <p>Welcome. My name is Amal Rahimli. I'm a 17 year old and
        I love to make stuff on the internet. I mainly like making digital stuff. Like websites, music,
            programs and videography/cinematography.
        On the other hand. I'm an hacking enthusiast. I used to legally hack into wifi's,
            domains and sometimes even network accounts.</p>


        <p>I live in the Netherlands, Nijmegen. My hobbies are skating, graffiti, drawing and writing. I love hanging
        out with friends and also partying. I can be flexible with most people.</p>

        <p>I can deal with tough situations and can help people with their
            problems. Also their personal problems</p>

        <p>My intention in life is to experience as much as I can before I die. I love to
        gain experience and learn from the things you messed up from and just try again. I'm not a fan of
        wasting time.</p>
