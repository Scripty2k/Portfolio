        <h1>About me</h1>

        <p>Hello. My name is Amal. I'm 18 years old and
            I love to make stuff on the internet. I mainly like making digital stuff. Like websites, music,
            programs and videography/cinematography.</p>

        <p>Scripty2k is my artist name. I produce electronic music, mixing breakcore, ambient, and drum and bass to create experimental and immersive sounds. Besides music, 
            I’m into filmmaking and cinematography, where I get to explore storytelling through visuals. I’m also inspired by travel and the idea of vanlife, 
            and I want to bring all 
            of these passions together in my projects, blending music, visuals, and experiences into something unique.</p>

        <p><b>According to Spotify,</b>
            Scripty2k is a producer of electronic music, blending intense breakcore, atmospheric ambient, and energetic drum and bass. With a passion for pushing sonic boundaries, Scripty2k crafts immersive soundscapes designed for those who crave deep, experimental beats. Beyond music, Scripty2k dives into filmmaking and cinematography, exploring creative storytelling through visual media. 

    Scripty2k aims to merge these passions, creating projects that reflect his journey, both musically and visually.

        <p>"Lawyers (INFJ) may be the rarest personality type of all, but they are definitely leaving their mark on the world. Idealistic and principled,
            they don't just flutter through life; they want to stand up and make a difference.
            For Lawyer personalities, success does not come from money or status, but from the search for fulfillment, helping others and being a
            positive force in the world."</p>

        <h2>Exra content</h2>

        <p>I currently live in Nijmegen, where I would love to skate, play guitar, make graffiti-art, and put my mind
        on poetry.

        <p>I really enjoy being outgoing and social,
            and I love spending time with friends and meeting new people. However, I also have my limits when it comes to social interactions.

            Just like a battery, my energy for socializing can run out. When that happens, I need some quiet time alone to recharge.
            It doesn't mean that I don't enjoy your company or that I don't want to be around people; it's just that I need a balance to feel my best.</p>
