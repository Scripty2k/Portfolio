        <h1>School videos</h1>
        <p>I also want to show these videos since they're also done well in my opinion. But they were for school so it wasn't really my vibe.</p>
        <p>This one was for a subject in school I had in year 1 of software development. This subject was called Creativity and
        the assignment I had was to make a videomapping video:</p>

        <p>This video was also meant for school. This video was made in the week of mental health awareness. I don't have to explain anything further.
        Just watch the video.</p>

        <p>This one wasn't my best video yet in my youtube channel. But I've tried doing better stuff. I like experimenting. I love this piece. This video
        makes me love life</p>

        <h1>Getting into short clips</h1>
        <p>Not long. but very powerful they say. Although I alwasy thought videos this short aren't finished. But thats incorrect. Whenever you think
        your video is finished, it just is. Only if there is a message behind it.</p>

        <h1>Getting into cinematography</h1>
        <p>This changed my filmmaking hobby. I finally learned color grading and the things that are on top of it. My friends supported my hobby and
        they helped me film them.</p>

        <h1>Summer 2022</h1>
        <p>Summer 2022 changed me. I made a video about it. I realized that friends are temporarily. So I made this video at first for myself
        to remind myself that I need to appreciate my time. A couple days later, my friends were upset about their enviorment, school, situations, etc.
        So I showed them this. They loved it.</p>

        <h1>First video</h1>
        <p>It was 3AM. I wanted to make people understand certain emotions that I feel whenever I think of something. Like my friends for example.
        I love to express emotions and feelings. My feelings are bigger than my mouth. So I decided to get into filmmaking. This was my first
        ever video</p>
