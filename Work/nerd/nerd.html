        <h1>Low poly medieval showcase (Finished!)</h1>
        <p>This showcase is all about low poly stuff. The models are not made by me. It's for a VR game that's currently finished! In this showcase, I have made a couple of stuff
        that includes things like arrow shooting physics and enemy collision.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Stuff to see right now:</p>
        <p>- Wind trails</p>
        <p>- Village</p>
        <p>- Paths</p>
        <p>- Dust particles</p>
        <p>- The whole map in general</p>
        <p>- Enemy behaviour (Patrolling, chasing the player and dying)</p>
        <p>- Actual archery mechanics (Like shooting with the bow)</p>

        <br>

        <p>This showcase is all about low poly stuff. The models are not made by me. It's for a VR game that's soon to be showed here because it's still in the making!
        But any way, I thought I could show this awesome showcase as the map for the Archery VR game I've been making for school and soon to be playable.
        More content of this coming up!</p>

        <h1>Mobile top down game</h1>
        <p>My first ever mobile game. This was just especially to aim to the functionality of the game </p>

        <p>So far it went well. Got a good grade for this anyway. And I sure was proud of it!</p>

        <br>

        <p>Stuff I added:</p>
        <p>- Keys to pick up and unlock the door</p>
        <p>- Dashing</p>
        <p>- Dying from enemies</p>
        <p>- Smooth camera follow</p>
        <p>- Camera zooming out whenever I enter an area or get near an enemy</p>

        <h1>2D Game</h1>
        <p>This is my game for period 5. I kinda rushed everything with design. I've spent time the most
        on scripting.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Stuff I added into the game:</p>
        <p>- Dash</p>
        <p>- Shoot</p>
        <p>- Die from enemy or object collision</p>

        <h1>Webshop</h1>
        <p>I made a webshop where I had to test my javascript skills. In this project I had to make a cart system where everything
        will get added and removed. My code is kinda messy but I was never good in javascript. I haven't got a grade back. I think it's fine</p>

        <p></p>


        <p>I used Webstorm for this. HTML CSS and Javascript</p>

        <h1>Personality assignment</h1>
        <p>I made a game for the subject called personality I had from previous year. This game was to show everything I was proud of. The game is still
        there on <a href="https://scripty2k.itch.io/vijfluik2">itch.io</a>.</p>

        <p>I have got a very good grade from this. Which I was very proud of. From this project, I learned to make keybinds for certain stuff like replay and mute.
        And what I also learned was making animations. I used C# for this game and where I made it was on Unity.</p>

        <h1>Henry2000</h1>
        <p>Since I was such an enthusiast about physical computing. I modified my raspberry pi pico to run payloads. I made a harmless payload
        that talks to you, gets your computer information and location.</p>

        <p>This gave me a good grade after all. It was fun since it was something I liked. I learned a lot. I feel like I've learned that I can do stuff with psysical
         computing. I used only a usb cable and notepad.</p>

        <h1>FPS Shooter (first game)</h1>
        <p>My first ever game. This game was made last year when I had to make a game for school. This is not my proudest work and I have made better
        things than this.</p>

        <p>This game was made in Unity with C#. I got a good grade from this assignment. It went very well. I've really learned stuff about how thirdperson and firstperson
        can be a lot to code. But it went well after all.</p>
